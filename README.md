## Short Description of ProtiDour
**ProtiDour** is an innovative Marathon Management System designed to streamline marathon event organization and participation. It allows users to create, update, and delete marathon events, explore detailed event listings, and manage their applications effortlessly. With features like secure login, real-time data management, and personalized dashboards, ProtiDour simplifies event coordination for organizers and participants. Built with modern technologies like React, Firebase, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and JWT, it ensures a secure and user-friendly experience, making marathon management efficient and accessible.


## Problem I Have Faced
During the development of **ProtiDour**, I faced several challenges as it was my first full-stack project involving JWT for authentication. Integrating login and registration using JWT was particularly tough. MongoDB CRUD operations, especially loading data by email for marathon pages and applications, were initially problematic, but I resolved them successfully. Implementing AOS animations and React counter circle also posed minor difficulties. Sorting data in MongoDB was challenging but achievable. Alhamdulillah, I overcame all obstacles and completed the project perfectly.
